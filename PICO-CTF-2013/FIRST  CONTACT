First Contact 


PROBLEM :


You notice that the indicator light near the robotâ€™s antenna begins to blink. Perhaps the robot is connecting to a network? Using a wireless card and the network protocol analyzer Wireshark, you are able to create a PCAP file containing the packets sent over the network.

You suspect that the robot is communicating with the crashed ship. Your goal is to find the location of the ship by inspecting the network traffic.

You can perform the analysis online on Cloudshark or you can download the PCAP file.


Hint:
It may help to learn a bit about network communication on the Internet and Wireshark.


SOLUTION :


Well , the link directs to the Wireshark with the PCAP file already loaded.

Two of the streams ( that lie in the end ) are highlighted in grey .
